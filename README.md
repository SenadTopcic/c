This is my learning path in C
In this folder are included project written in C

ft_printf.c                 recode printf()

get_next_line.c             This project is about programming a function that returns a line read from a file descriptor

libft.c                     This project is about coding a C library

minitalk.c                  The purpose of this project is to code a small data exchange program
                            using UNIX signals.

push_swap.c                 This project will make you sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using
                            the lowest possible number of actions. To succeed youâ€™ll have to manipulate various
                            types of algorithms and choose the most appropriate solution (out of many) for an
                            optimized data sorting.

learn_c

    divisibleByFive.c       This is a C Program which calculates the number of integers divisible by 5 in the given range.

    evenOrOdd.c             is even or odd
    increaseAllDigOne.c     This program increases 1 to all of the given integer digit and print the sum of all digits
    largestNumOfTree.c      C program that takes the 3 numbers, sort them and finds the largest number Aamong three numbers.
    sumOfDigits.c           Sum of digits in a C program allows a user to enter any number, divide that number into individual
                            numbers, and sum     those individual numbers.
    sumOfEvenOddInRange.c   The program takes the number N and finds the sum of odd and even numbers from 1 to N.
    swapTwoNumbers.c        Write a C program that swaps the values of two variables based on user input.
